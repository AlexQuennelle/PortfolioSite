      A while ago I saw this video by SethBling about
      <a href="https://youtu.be/DhCBCudKJTs?si=zc_XhQuwcQeqSf7i">3D rigidbody physics in Minecraft</a>
      using the Separating Axis Theorem for collision detection, and the idea
      really resonated with me. After seeing this video and reading up on the
      concept, I used the knowledge to add proper 2D polygon colliders to a
      Terraria clone I had been working on at the time in order to learn C#
      outside the context of the Unity Game Engine. By now I've used this
      method in several projects, including
      <a href="../Asteroids/index.html">an implementation of Asteroids</a> for
      college. But, all of the projects I've done using SAT so far have been
      3D, and being the massive dweeb that I am, I've always wanted to try it
      in 3D. What better time to try some massive new project than a month
      before college starts back up again?

      Before getting into how I've implemented things, I should probably
      explain what the SAT acutally is. In all honesty it's pretty simple as
      long as you understand a few core concepts, namely the dot product of
      vectors. The dot product can be thought of as an operation that rotates
      2 vectors such that one of them aligns with the x axis, and returns the
      x component of the other vector multiplied by the first vector's length.
      For our purposes today, we can ignore that final multiplication because
      we can always assume at least one of our vectors is normalized, and has
      a length of 1. The effect this has is that doing the dot product casts a
      "shadow" of
      <img src="Shadow.gif" alt="" style="padding: 0.25em; float: left" />
      one vector onto the other, and gives us where that "shadow" lands on the
      x axis. The other main concept to understand is that for any 2 convex
      shapes that are not overlapping, there exists at least one axis onto
      which they can be projected and their shadows don't overlap. That one is
      pretty obvious if you think about it, but the important part is that we
      can very easily find that axisâ€”in fact this is pretty much the entirety
      of the Separating Axis Theorem. It turns out that in 2D, you only need
      to check the axes perpendicular to each side of both objects and you're
      guaranteed to find the separating axis if it exists.
