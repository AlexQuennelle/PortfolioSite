        A while ago I saw this video by SethBling about
        <a href="https://youtu.be/DhCBCudKJTs?si=zc_XhQuwcQeqSf7i">3D rigidbody physics in Minecraft</a>
        using the Separating Axis Theorem for collision detection, and the
        idea really resonated with me. After seeing this video and reading up
        on the concept, I used the knowledge to add proper 2D polygon
        colliders to a Terraria clone I had been working on at the time in
        order to learn C# outside the context of the Unity Game Engine. By now
        I've used this method in several projects, including
        <a href="../Asteroids/index.html">an implementation of Asteroids</a>
        for college. But, all of the projects I've done using SAT so far have
        been 2D, and being the massive dweeb that I am, I've always wanted to
        try it in 3D. What better time to try some massive new project than a
        month before college starts back up again?

      <h2>Getting literally anything to work</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="dotprod.gif" alt="Animated gif that showcases how the dot product works"
          style="padding: 0.25em; float: right" />
        Before getting into how I've implemented things, I should probably
        explain what the SAT actually is. In all honesty it's pretty simple as
        long as you understand a few core concepts, namely the dot product of
        vectors. The dot product can be thought of as an operation that
        rotates 2 vectors such that one of them aligns with the x axis, and
        returns the x component of the other vector multiplied by the first
        vector's length. For our purposes today, we can ignore that final
        multiplication because we can always assume at least one of our
        vectors is normalized, and has a length of 1. The effect this has is
        that doing the dot product casts a "shadow" of
        <img src="Shadow.gif" alt="" style="padding: 0.25em; float: left" />
        one vector onto the other, and gives us where that "shadow" lands on
        the x axis. The other main concept to understand is that for any 2
        convex shapes that are not overlapping, there exists at least one axis
        onto which they can be projected and their shadows don't overlap. That
        one is pretty obvious if you think about it, but the important part is
        that we can very easily find that axis—in fact this is pretty much the
        entirety of the Separating Axis Theorem. It turns out that in 2D, you
        only need to check the axes perpendicular to each side of both objects
        and you're guaranteed to find the separating axis if it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have our foundation, it's pretty easy to get started
        implementing the system! One important consideration is that the SAT
        <strong>only</strong> works for convex shapes, so any complex shapes
        with concavities will need multiple colliders. The most simple way of
        dealing with this is just to have each object store a
        <code>std::vector&ltT></code> of colliders, but I think that there's
        aesthetically a lot to be desired with that option. Instead, I opted
        to have a base <code>Collider</code> class, and have
        <code>MeshCollider</code> and <code>CompoundCollider</code> derive
        from it. That way, when an object only needs a single collider, it
        only needs to store that one collider, but more complex objects can
        have a compound of several in the same slot. This might not be the
        best approach, but I like it because of the aforementioned aesthetics,
        and it gives me the flexibility to add specialized collider types down
        the line like a sphere. I don't know if that will be worth the effort,
        but it's nice to have the option. The main type of collider I'm going
        to be talking about going forward is going to be the mesh collider,
        which has a vector of vertices, and a vector of normals. Now we just
        need to make a function that takes in 2 colliders, splits up any
        compound colliders, and then checks for an overlap.
      </p>
      <pre><code id="overlapCheckV1.txt"></code></pre>
      <p>
        Now, for code I wrote in a super sleep-deprived state in a discord
        call with while my equally sleep-deprived friends played games and
        built Lego, I'd say this function turned out pretty good. It has a few
        problems I'll go over later, but for now it worked well enough that I
        was tricked into thinking it was done based on the console log testing
        I was doing. The function takes in a transformation matrix for each
        collider to put them into world-space, and the loop breaks as soon as
        a separating axis is found to avoid redundant work. This may change
        later, as it might be necessary to complete the loop to find the exact
        location in 3D space the collision occurred. I also made the function
        return an
        <code>std::optional&ltT></code> of a hit object to pass info about the
        collision back out for resolution later, and created a simple struct
        of 2 floats representing the range of values a collider covers when
        projected onto normal. With this done, I can finally start making some
        objects to attach these colliders to and draw to the screen!

    <div id="milestone-2">
      <h2>Getting something to render</h2>
      <p>
        The first step of getting something drawing to the screen, is creating
        a class to contain all the data related to rendering and simulating a
        given object. This class doesn't need a whole lot in it at the moment,
        just some transformation matrices, a mesh material and shader for
        rendering, and a collider. In terms of methods, all it's got is some
        setters and getters for the data, and functions for logic updates and
        rendering(<code>Update()</code> and <code>Draw()</code> respectively).
        I also took the time to set up a <code>World</code> class. There's not
        much in there at the moment, but it lets me bundle up all my global
        data and the internal logic in a much more organized place. From
        there, all I needed to do was loop through all the objects in the
        world and call their update and draw meshes, while also calling the
        collision check method against every other object. It's not optimized
        or efficient, but at the moment I'm looping through the objects 3
        separate times(plus one nested loop) for simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point it should have been time to move on to implementing
        collision resolution, but you may remember I mentioned that I wrote a
        good chunk of the code under what might be called "sub-optimal
        conditions". That's right, my sleep deprived code I
        <strong>thought</strong> was working is now coming back to bite me in
        the behind. I might not have noticed a lot of these issues if I hadn't
        swapped one of the cubes I was testing with for another shape as a
        sanity check, because it just so happened most of my mistakes involved
        accidentally discarding the results of transformations in several fun
        flavours. Chief among those was calling raylib's vector and matrix
        transformation functions and forgetting to actually assign the
        returned result to anything. I did this in a few different places,
        alongside some places where I tried assigning to the temporary
        variable in range-based <code>for</code> loops over vectors of points.
        It was quite a lot of fixing to be done, and in the process I also
        discovered that the web builds using
        <a href="https://emscripten.org/index.html">Emscripten</a> were
        completely borked, which led to even more fixing. Unfortunately for
        me, that wasn't even the end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have noticed all the way back in my explanation of the
        Separating Axis Theorem, I specifically talked about how you can find
        the axes that need to be tested in 2D, but didn't say anything about
        how that might be different in 3D. That's because I had completely
        forgotten that it was different. I don't know that I can blame this
        mistake on a lack of sleep, but I will use the excuse that it had been
        at least a year and a half since I had seen the video explaining the
        concept in 3D. The thing is, using only the normals of the objects
        works in most cases where 2 cubes are being tested, even if they are
        rotated. The problem happens when the cubes are rotated in odd but
        common ways relative to one another, and the overlap detection returns
        a false positive. To get rid of this issue(and presumably similar
        issues with more complex shapes), you need to loop through every edge
        on one shape, and take the cross product of it with every edge on the
        other shape and check the resulting direction vectors on top of the
        face normals. Since the cross product is an operation that returns a
        new vector perpendicular to both inputs, and the false positives
        happen when 2 edges are oriented weirdly relative to one another, it
        makes sense that checking these axes would eliminate the issue. With
        the problem identified, it wasn't that big a deal to actually solve
        it. The main change that needed to be made was that colliders need to
        store their edges, which I decided to solve by storing a vector of
        index pairs that refer to the vector of vertices. A fun side effect of
        solving this issue was that I was able to render colliders using
        raylib's <code>DrawLine3D()</code> function, which is a lot nicer for
        visualizing collisions than my previous solution of changing the
        colour of the whole object. And with that lengthy detour out of the
        way, it's finally time to move on to using the information from the
        SAT to resolve the collisions!

        Everything thus far was written after the fact, because I hadn't
        decided to document the making of this project in this much detail
        yet, but from here on each segment will be written as I go through
        them.

        At this point I figured it would be useful to have some ability to
        inspect and modify objects at runtime. Obviously I don't need any sort
        of reflection system for a small personal project like this, but being
        able to see and modify the transform data of a physics object without
        recompiling the project would be very nice. So, I decided that before
        moving on to collision resolution, I would implement raycasting to
        select objects in the scene, and bring in
        <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> to display
        relevant information. I had never used ImGui before, but had heard
        about it in passing and thought it a great fit for my purposes. After
        some struggling with outdated documentation and git hashes, I was able
        to get it up and running with the help of a nice compatibility library
        called <a href="https://github.com/raylib-extras/rlImGui">rlImGui</a>.
        Now that I had ImGui ready to use, it was time for raycasting, and
        this is where the title of this section comes in to play. You see, up
        to this point I had kind been going off vibes and what little
        knowledge I already had about 3D physics in games. I had some idea of
        how it might work, and thought I could work it out as long as I had my
        Separating Axis Theorem implementation in place to support it all. I
        found out just how wrong I was the moment I began to look into how
        raycasting works—something I had no idea about whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some googling and digging through forum posts, I was able to
        find
        <a href="https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/405/notes/raypolygon.pdf">this</a>
        document going over raycasting, and
        <a href="https://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/2015/DirkGregorius_Contacts.pdf">this</a>
        document on 3D physics. In the second one—a document from valve—the
        author explains very early on that they use the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">Half-Edge data structure</a>
        AKA the Doubly Connected Edge List, and it became very apparent why as
        soon as I started to read the first document. The Half-Edge data
        structure makes it much easier to represent and iterate over
        adjacencies like "all the edges that make up a face" or "all connected
        faces". I had already started to move in that direction when I
        realized previously that I needed to keep track of edges and what
        vertices make them up, but I didn't quite think about how else I might
        need to care about the relations between elements of the polyhedron.
        So, I decided to read up on the data structure and implement my own
        version. At first I made something very 'by the books' with loosely
        connected Edge Face and Vertex objects that are related only by
        pointers. This wasn't very convenient for my purposes, and I didn't
        like how nothing was guaranteed to be next to anything else in memory,
        so I instead changed the structure to exist inside a 'container' class
        in a series of vectors. Then, each object can store a single pointer
        for each vector it needs to access, and the index of the object it's
        related to. As an example, the all important Edge class looks
        something like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code id="halfEdge.txt"></code></pre>
      <p>
        I'll save you the exhaustive detail, but trying to integrate this
        system was a massive headache that took several days of work before I
        was even able to make sure I'd structured it all correctly. I spent
        many hours getting segfaults and seemingly inexplicable errors that
        ultimately boiled down to either not understanding how the
        <code>std::map&ltT></code> structure stores it's members, or looking
        in the complete wrong part of the code. Perhaps the funniest example
        of the latter was towards the end of the process, when I spent nearly
        8 hours debugging things trying to find one problem and solving about
        a dozen others along the way, only to realize in the end that I was
        simply providing the vertices in the wrong order so none of the half
        edges where being paired with their opposite, since they were both
        pointing in the same direction. After finally solving that, the
        raycasting itself was almost child's play by comparison and only took
        me a day or 2 of work to get fully functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, it was a simple matter to do a raycast from the mouse and
        store a pointer to whatever object(if any) was hit, and display it's
        position in an ImGui window. That info gets displayed as a series of
        input fields, and the temporary Vector3 ImGui uses can be fed back to
        the object at the end of the tick to change it's position at runtime!
