      A while ago I saw this video by SethBling about <a href="https://youtu.be/DhCBCudKJTs?si=zc_XhQuwcQeqSf7i">3D
        rigidbody physics in Minecraft</a> using the Separating Axis Theorem for collision detection, and the idea
      really resonated with me. After seeing this video and reading up on the concept, I used the knowledge to add
      proper 2D polygon colliders to a Terraria clone I had been working on at the time in order to learn C# outside the
      context of the Unity Game Engine. By now I've used this method in several projects, including <a
        href="../Asteroids/index.html">an implementation of Asteroids</a> for college. But, all of the projects I've
      done using SAT so far have been 3D, and being the massive dweeb that I am, I've always wanted to try it in 3D.
      What better time to try some massive new project than a month before college starts back up again?

    <p>
      Before getting into how I've implemented things, I should probably explain what the SAT acutally is.
      In all honesty it's pretty simple as long as you understand a few core concepts, namely the dot product of
      vectors. You might have been told that the dot product mesures how closely alighned 2 vectors are, and while
      that's technically true, it's more useful to think of it as an operation that projects one vector onto another,
      like a shadow.
